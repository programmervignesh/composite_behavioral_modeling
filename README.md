## 🧠 Composite Behavioral Modeling for Identity Theft Detection in Online Social Networks

### 📘 Overview

This project focuses on detecting **identity theft and anomalous user behavior** in online social networks using a **composite behavioral modeling approach**. The model analyzes user interaction patterns, posting activities, and connection behavior to identify deviations from normal profiles that may indicate identity misuse or fraudulent activity.

By combining **behavioral analytics**, **machine learning**, and **data-driven pattern recognition**, the system enhances the accuracy of detecting suspicious activities and protects social network users from potential threats.

### 🎯 Objectives

* Develop a **behavioral model** that profiles user activity patterns.
* Detect **identity theft incidents** through anomalous behavior analysis.
* Improve **accuracy and precision** of fraud detection compared to single-model approaches.
* Visualize findings and detection results for better interpretation.
